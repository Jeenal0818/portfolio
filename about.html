<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! It's Jeenal Bolia from Rajasthan, India. I'm currently pursuing B.Tech degree from Mody University and I'm 18 years old. </br>
  I have always wanted to do thinge at my own like an independent woman, this is the main reason why I choose this course. Now secondly, 
  it was my father's wish to become a web developer, due to some circumstances, he didn't manage to do that, so I decided to choose this skill over others.
